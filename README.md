<h2>Initiation</h2>

<p align="justify">When starting the development processes, I took to previous lessons of semantic HTML to understand where content should go and how it would look, before implementing the CSS styles. I had used this to create a basic layout in the first assessment and would change the content as the site progressed throughout the second assessment. I had originally looked into websites that used HTML and CSS only, to gather information for a planned structure of the content. So after browsing Tooplate.com, a free HTML template site, I had gotten inspiration to develop a site that was minimal and used sectioned content. However, as with most templating websites, they use a lot more than just HTML and CSS. This, in turn, is good and bad. Most of my original ideas for this website were constrained without the use of things like Bootstrap, but in the end, the content was styled as expected with just CSS.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p align="justify">There are three major iterations that this CSS Sketch assessment went through. Each change created a different structure to the overall content on the site and the final look. The major problem with the first iteration was the colour and tone of the website. I had a grey background with mostly grey blocky content. Despite it sectioning off content as intended, it wasn’t aesthetically pleasing. The second iteration developed as I was toggling the CSS on and off on Chromes developer tools. I had removed the background, the sections borders and made the articles border edges rounder. This improved the overall look that eventually inspired a re-design of the actual content. The third and final iteration started to develop as I deleted some of the main content and sectioned off the starting content to both the left and right sides. This gave the final site a much more pleasing design and all that was left to change was the colour of the headings. The finished site now has a more historic record feel, with room for future content. 
As for the development of the CSS code itself, I tried to include as much of the slide content as possible, that being; the box model, positioning, typography etc. This created no issues as the only thing I didn’t originally incorporate was a wrapper. Eventually, I did replace a CSS style to use a wrapper to better place text on the banner image. I had also incorporated the @charset rule, which according to W3Schools, “specifies the character encoding used in the style sheet” (W3schools.com, 2019).</p>

<h2>Testing / Validation</h2>

<p align="justify">Testing was a test-as-you-work implementation. I had used the (W3C Markup Validation Service) to validate the code online, and two formatting services for both HTML (FreeFormatter.com) and CSS (Cleancss.com). Using these enabled me to regularly check that the code I was writing met certain standards and if the code would work online.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p align="justify">I had learned that the order in which you link your CSS file into your HTML file was important, similar to how CSS selectors have specificity and inheritance. The User Agent Style Sheet was also still present in Chrome despite the Normalise CSS page being implemented, I was unable to find out the cause of this.</p>

<h2>Future Development</h2>

<p align="justify">There are a few things I want to put into the final production of this website, mainly to do with aesthetics. But there is also room for form elements, better navigation and especially usability issues. I intend to add better meta-data to increase usability for those with disabilities, as this is a major requirement in most web development practices.</p>
